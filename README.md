# Garbled Inference: Modular privacy-preserving activation functions
Secure multi-party computational approach to activation layers of pre-trained deep learning classifiers using Yao's Garbled Circuit Protocol [1].
The implementation of that protocol used here is a modified version of TinyGarble [2].

# Build and Usage
Compile the two binaries.

``` bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make client
$ make server 
```

Now in two separate concurrent processes, start the client application and then the server.
``` bash
$ ./client
```
``` bash
$ ./server
```
